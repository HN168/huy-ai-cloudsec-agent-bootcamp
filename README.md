# 🛡️ Huy's AI Cloud Security Agent Bootcamp

**Building AI-powered Security Operations and Cloud Security agents leveraging AWS expertise, SOC experience, and 8 GIAC cloud/security certifications**

A hands-on bootcamp where I apply my cloud security and SOC experience to build AI-powered security agents, preparing for the next generation of cloud security engineering roles.

## 🎯 Bootcamp Goals

**Career Objective:** Transition to ** AI Cloud Security Engineer** roles  
**Timeline:** 12-15 months of structured learning and building  
**Approach:** Combine my existing cloud security expertise with AI agent development skills

### **What I'm Building To Learn**
- 🤖 **AI Security Agents** that automate cloud security workflows
- ☁️ **Cloud-Native Automation** using AWS security services  
- 🧠 **Threat Intelligence Systems** with AI-powered analysis
- 🔧 **Multi-Agent Orchestration** for complex security operations

### **Skills I'm Developing**
- **Technical**: Python development, AI agent frameworks, cloud automation
- **AI/ML**: LangChain, vector databases, prompt engineering, RAG systems
- **Architecture**: Multi-agent systems, serverless security, cloud-native design
- **Integration**: AWS security services, SIEM/SOAR, threat intelligence APIs
